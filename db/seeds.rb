Close the bat angle slightly. Rotate backwards from the waist. As the ball approaches, rotate forwards and move your bat forwards and up. Contact the ball just in front of your body. The contact should be quite flat, roughly in the middle of your bat. Your bat should follow through and finish in front of your body", is_favorite: "false", video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNZrtYsvKhE")

Plan your serve to exploit your strengths and your opponent‚Äôs weaknesses.

Stance can be square to the table or you can have your right foot slightly further back (as in the forehand drive). Knees should be slightly bent and the body should be leaning forward. You may want to be slightly lower for a push as usually we play this shot against lower, backspin balls. Both arms should be out in front of you. About a 90-110 degree bend at the elbow. Stand quite close to the table, an arms length away. Weight distributed on both feet and on the balls/toes, not heels.", is_favorite: "false", video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3D9VWKR-iFc")

Stay low with your knees bent. Lean forward so that your head and body are near the ball. Your weight will be on your ‚Äúplaying foot‚Äù. Keep your arm out in front of you. You don‚Äôt need a big backswing. Take the ball at the peak of the bounce. This will make it much easier to attack. Your bat you follow the ball, finishing toward the net and coming slightly up. Remember to step back out with your ‚Äúplaying foot‚Äù and return to a neutral ready position. Get ready to loop the next ball.", is_favorite: "false", video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mC0H6OLL_4M")

skill6 = SkillSet.create(title: "Side Spin", image: "https://recroompick.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/How-to-Spin-a-Ping-Pong-Ball-main.jpg", category: "Expert", description: "As you can imagine from the name, a sidespin occurs when you hit the ball with your paddle on the side of the ball. You can create a sidespin from either the right or the left side, depending on how you hit the ball. Basically, if you hit the ball and move the racket to the right, the ball will move in the opposite direction, to the left. The faster you move your paddle, the faster your ball will move. Furthermore, a sidespin often occurs with either a topspin or a backspin. This type of spin is often used when you are serving, so the better you understand it, the better you can be prepared for your opponent to use it when opening a game.", is_favorite: "false", video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JRN4q8mdwJ0")
